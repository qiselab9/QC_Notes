# Docker Setup Instructions for Jupyter Environment with GUI Support

## Prerequisites
1. Install Docker and Docker Compose on your system:
   - [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
   - [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
   - [Docker for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

2. Git (Verify if git is installed using `git --version` command)

   ### 1. Follow these steps to install git on your operating system

   <summary>Windows</summary>

      1. Download Git from [https://git-scm.com/downloads/win](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)
      2. Run the installer, using default settings (or customize if you prefer)

      Install using Homebrew (recommended):

      ```bash
      # Install Homebrew if not installed
      /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"

      # Install Git
      brew install git
      ```
      Or download installer from [https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

   <summary>Linux</summary>

      * Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

      ```bash
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install git-all
      ```
      
      OR

      Use [this](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) documentation to install git in linux (according to your linux distribution)
   </details>

   ### 2. Verify installation:

   Verify installation by opening Command Prompt or PowerShell and typing:
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```
   ### 3. Configure Git (First-time setup)

   ``` bash
   # Set your name
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   # Set your email
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   # Optional: Set default branch name to main
   git config --global init.defaultBranch main
   ```

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1 - Running from pre-built image (Easier)


You can quickly run this environment without cloning the repository by pulling directly from DockerHub:
```bash
docker pull sahil624/qc_notes:latest
```

**Run the container**

``` bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 -p 8080:8080 sahil624/qc_notes:latest
```

Access Jupyter Lab at `http://localhost:8888` and noVNC at `http://localhost:8080/vnc.html` as described in the Usage Instructions section below.

**Note:** When running this way, any changes you make will be lost when the container stops. For persistent storage, use the volume mounting option:

``` bash
# Run with persistent storage
docker run -p 8888:8888 -p 8080:8080 -v ./notebooks:<any_path_in_host_to save_data> sahil624/qc_notes:latest
```

### Option 2 - Building image from source code

1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux)

2. Navigate to where you want to store the project:

   ``` bash
      # Windows example (Use your desired directory)
      cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents

      # Mac/Linux example (Use your desired directory)
      cd ~/Documents
   ```
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sahil624/QC_Notes.git
cd QC_Notes
git checkout origin/docker-setup
```

2. Start the containers (This will take few minutes to run):
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Usage Instructions

1. Access Jupyter Lab:
   - Open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost:8888`
   - You'll see the Jupyter Lab interface with your notebooks

2. For viewing the simulation in Learning Object "22.4 The E91 Protocol":
   - Before running the simulation cells, open a new browser tab and go to: `http://localhost:8080/vnc.html`
   - Keep this tab open while running the simulation cells
   - The simulation will appear in this virtual desktop window
   - If you don't open this window before running the simulation, you won't be able to see the visualization

## How it Works
- The setup uses two containers:
  1. Jupyter container: Runs your notebooks and Tkinter applications
  2. noVNC container: Provides the virtual display server and web interface
- The simulation in LO 22.4 will display its GUI in the noVNC window

## Troubleshooting

1. If you can't see the simulation:
   - Make sure you opened `http://localhost:8080` before running the simulation cells
   - Keep the noVNC tab open while running the simulation
   - Try rerunning the notebook cells
   - If still not working, restart the Jupyter kernel and try again

2. If ports are already in use, modify the port mappings in docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
ports:
  - "8889:8888"  # For Jupyter
  - "8081:8080"  # For noVNC
```

3. If containers don't start properly:
```bash
# Check container logs
docker compose logs

# Rebuild containers
docker compose up --build --force-recreate
```

4. To stop the containers:
```bash
docker compose down
```

## Common Commands
```bash
# Start containers in background
docker compose up -d

# View container logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop containers
docker compose down

# Rebuild and restart containers
docker compose up --build --force-recreate
```
